// Option --user : Consider using the `--user` option or check the permissions:

You can also install it part by part.

This is what you would probably do once you want to deploy your application to production:
>pip install fastapi --user

Also install uvicorn to work as the server:
>pip install "uvicorn[standard]" --user

And the same for each of the optional dependencies that you want to use.

//Upgrade pip
>py -m pip install --upgrade pip --user

//Start the web app
>py -m uvicorn main:app --reload
PS D:\Drive_E\Workspace_Python\PySamples\FastApi> py -m uvicorn main:app --reload


or

>uvicorn main:app --reload
